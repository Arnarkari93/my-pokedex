# my-pokedex

## Greetings

Welcome fellow traveler. It's time to dive into the world of hooks. You might even "hook" some Pokemon ðŸ˜…

### The objective

Implement a Pokedex using react hooks.

### Scoring

- [x] (10 pt) Display a list of the Pokemon
- [x] (10 pt) Select a Pokemon and open in a modal with more information
- [x] (10 pt) Search a Pokemon by name
- [x] (10 pt) Set focus on search box on page load
- [x] (10 pt) Mark/Unmark a Pokemon as favorite
- (20 pt) Filter Pokemon by favorites and toggle the filter by key press (e.g. `f`)

### Resources

- Use components `Pokemon` and `PokemonDetails` (basically the same but feel free to change and add stuff to the `PokemonDetails`)
- GraphQL API https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/ (already set up)

### Scoring and Reward

The team with the highest score wins (or first to finish!). E.g. if team A has 50 points and team B has 40 points, team A will be the winner. (Please don't name your team either A or B, they are taken!) The reward will depend on the winners ðŸ¤·.
