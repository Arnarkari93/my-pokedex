# my-pokedex

## Greetings
Welcome fellow traveler. It's time to dive into the world of hooks. You might even "hook" some Pokemon ðŸ˜…

### The objective
Implement a Pokedex using react hooks.

### Scoring
- (10 pt) Display a list of the Pokemon
- (10 pt) Select a Pokemon and open in a modal with more information
- (10 pt) Close the modal after 5 seconds
- (10 pt) Search a Pokemon by name
- (10 pt) Navigate inside a modal to the next/previous Pokemon using the arrow keys
- (10 pt) Mark a Pokemon as favorite
- (10 pt) Filter Pokemon by favorites

### Resources
- Basic UI to copy: https://pokedex.org/
- GraphQL API https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/

### Scoring and Reward
The team with the highest score wins. E.g. if team A has 50 points and team B has 40 points, team A will be the winner. (Please don't name your team either A or B, they are taken!) The reward will depend on the winners.
